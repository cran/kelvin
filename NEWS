kelvin 1.0-1 (2012-07-27) ---------------------------------------- NOT RELEASED

* bug fix: scaling was inappropriately applied if nSeq>1, meaning that
    higher order functions would have incorrect sign. Checked consistency 
    in higher order terms with figures on Wolfram's site.

* warning: This may not be a problem, especially since the developer of 
    Bessel is a core contributer (likely aware of the conflict, and 
    comfortable with it), but importing Bessel overrides fundamental base::
    functions such as cbind, %*%, etc.  This worries me somewhat, but hasn't 
    been an issue as of yet.
